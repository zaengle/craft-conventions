# Conventions plugin for Craft CMS 4.x

[![Latest Stable Version](http://poser.pugx.org/zaengle/craft-conventions/v)](https://packagist.org/packages/zaengle/craft-conventions) [![Buy us a tree](https://img.shields.io/badge/Treeware-%F0%9F%8C%B3-lightgreen)](https://plant.treeware.earth/zaengle/craft-toolbelt) [![License](http://poser.pugx.org/zaengle/craft-conventions/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/zaengle/craft-conventions)

The Conventions plugin helps you maintain a consistent template structure both within and across your Craft CMS projects, by making it easy to define and use twig helper functions that act as improved replacements for Twig's native `{% include %}` tag. These functions are designed to help you write cleaner, more consistent templates with less boilerplate.

Turn this:

```twig
{% include('_components/blog/card') with { data: myData } only %}
```
Into this:

```twig

{{ component('card/blog', { data: myData }) }}
```

with just a single line definition in a config file.
