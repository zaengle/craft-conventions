# Installation

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 4.1.0 & PHP 8.0+

## Installation

```bash
composer require zaengle/craft-conventions
./craft plugin/install conventions
```

### Configuring the plugin

Conventions is entirely configured via it's config file, a starter version of which will be created at `config/conventions.php` as part of the plugin install command. It ships with defaults that suit how we work at [Zaengle](https://zaengle.com/), but it is completely customisable to fit your own workflow.

See the [next page](/01-basic-usage.md) for more information about how to set the plugin up for your needs.
